# basic-portfolio
This repository contains a small HTML and CSS website. There are no dependencies and there's nothing particularly fancy going on. Just a connection to Netflify, the website host.

## Who is Bobby Pancakes?
A rogue halfling character in the excellent [Dragon Friends](https://thedragonfriends.com/about/) D&D podcast. Played by Simon Greiner.

### Image credit

## Live website
Check out the [live website](https://wtd-basic-portfolio.netlify.app/) to see what this website looks like.

### Under development
Right now, this is really nothing special. However, I intend to improve this example so people can use it as a starting point.

## Publishing this site to the web via Netlify
The [docs-basic-portfolio](https://github.com/bobby-pancakes/basic-portfolio) repository is a companion to this one. It details how to get a simple HTML and CSS website live on the internet via Netlify.

# basic-portfolio
This repository contains a small HTML and CSS website. There are no dependencies and there's nothing particularly fancy going on. Just a connection to Netflify, the website host.

## Who is Dr. Lyntel'luroon?
Other than being the example for this portfolio, Trystan is an player character in the [Campaign podcast](https://one-shot.fandom.com/wiki/Campaign:Campaign) and is played by [Kat Kuhl](https://one-shot.fandom.com/wiki/Kat_Kuhl).

If you like Star Wars, RPGs, and comedians, you should definitely listen to Campaign!

### Image credit
Marian Churchland drew the portrait of Trystan used on this site.

## Live website
Check out the [live website](https://wtd-basic-portfolio.netlify.app/) to see what this website looks like.

### Under development
Right now, this is really nothing special. However, I intend to improve this example so people can use it as a starting point.

## Publishing this site to the web via Netlify
The [docs-basic-portfolio](https://github.com/bobby-pancakes/basic-portfolio) repository is a companion to this one. It details how to get a simple HTML and CSS website live on the internet via Netlify.
